[7.1 Introduction to Latent Variable Modeling]

[Missing noun: "from the latent" should be "from the latent variable"]

[Current]     From this correlation, we can obtain a path coefficient from the latent to the indicator variable.
[Recommended] From this correlation, we can obtain a path coefficient from the latent variable to the indicator variable.

[Current]     We will get the calculation of [zeta] now because involves the value of the path(s) leading into the endogenous [nyu].
[Recommended] We will get the calculation of [zeta] now because this involves the values of one or more paths leading into the endogenous [nyu].

[7.3 Latent Variables in lavaan]

[Below statement is not clear to me. If the unstandardized coefficient is unchanged, it is not clear how it is unchanged -- especially since the unstandardized coefficient of the previous model (where the error for x was fixed) seems to be very different.]

The unstandardized coefficient, however, is unchanged: � = 0.792. This is in contrast to the earlier latent variable model, where the unstandardized estimate was 0.989.

[The below sentence appears to be contradictory. First, it claims that incorporating measurement error in endogenous latent variables "resolves some of the downward bias" in the "unstandardized coefficient and error variance" but "not the unstandardized coefficient." But it just said that it does resolve some of the downward bias in the undstandardized coefficient.]

Thus, we see that incorporating measurement error in endogenous latent variables resolves some of the downward bias in the unstandardized coefficient and error variance, but not the unstandardized coefficient.

[7.4 Multi-indicator Latent Variables]

[Misspelled word: "simpy" should be "simply"]

[Current]     where the path coefficients are simpy
[Recommended] where the path coefficients are simply

[Spelled-out word "lambda1" is used instead of greek symbol.]

[Partial sentence] To estimate values for the latent construct we need to estimate lambda1

#######

[Irregular use of numbers and spelled-out numbers. Either "1" should be "one" or "two" should be "2". This consistency should be checked for throughout the document.]

[Current]     we need only solve for the two [lambdas]s, but we only have 1 piece of information
[Recommend1]  we need only solve for the two [lambdas]s, but we only have one piece of information
[Recommend2]  we need only solve for the 2 [lambda]s, but we only have 1 piece of information

[My preference would be for Recommend1]

[Sentence] Thus, the correlation  r_x1,x2 = lambda1 � [lambda]2.

[x_i (x sub i) does not appear in the RHS of the equation.]

[Sentence before LATEX equation] Finally, we can obtain an integrated estimate of reliability from multi-indicator latent variables using the following equation:

[Not clear: "where j is the number of indicator variables." Since you are using the sigma summation sign, do you mean "where j is the index of each indicator variable"?]

[8.2 Constructing a Composite Variable]

[Unnecessary word: "we"]

[Current]     This is because we the composite is in units of the predicted values of the response.
[Recommended] This is because the composite is in units of the predicted values of the response.

[Opposite word indicated: "unstandardized" should be "standardized"]

[Current]     However, the unstandardized coefficient is 0.177
[Recommended] However, the standardized coefficient is 0.177

#######

[Unclear (to me) where some statistics are coming from]

[You say:] However, the standardized coefficient is different from what we know the true relationship to be (0.236 vs. 0.177).

[But the standardized coefficient 0.177 is the same in comp_model1,
and the only place 0.236 comes in the lavaan summary is the p-value,
as below for comp_model3:]

Regressions:

[8.3 Grace & Keeley Revisited: A Worked Example]

[Space between two words needed: "fitdifferent" should be "fit different"]

[Current]     we fitdifferent sub-models of their larger model
[Recommended] we fit different sub-models of their larger model


[from Audrey Barker-Plotkin]

Note that the unstandardized coefficient is no longer 1: this is because the scale of the composite has been set to that of the second indicator. However, the standardized coefficient is different from what we know the true relationship to be (0.236 vs. 0.177).
For this reason, it is generally recommended that one compute the loadings by hand and fix them in the model. This has an added benefit we will get to in a later section. But first let’s explore a real-world example.)
I’m pretty sure the two approaches do both come to the same standardized coefficient (0.177). Maybe there is a different example you could use where the two differ, to support your final point.

lm(firesev~cover,keeley) in your model? According to the graphic, 'firesev' is the predictor of cover, isn't it?  


3.2 Test of Directed Separation
"In the case of underidentified models (those where there are more pieces of known information than parameters to be estimated), this means there are missing relationships that could be present but were not included."

Should this possibly say underidentified models have fewer pieces of known information?

chapter 2.2
The text explains this in the following way: "Introducing this path raises a new issue: the relationship between y1 and y2 now arises from two sources. The first is their direct link, the second is from the indirect effect of 
x1x1 through y1." 
This was confusing to me because, in this path diagram, there appears to be only one relationship between y1 and y2 since there is only one arrow coming from y1. Furthermore, this explanation ignores the new path that was just drawn between x1 and y2, which seemed to be the point of this section. Is it possible that y1 in the highlighted section should say x1? This would make more sense to me, but I am still learning the theory and math behind this.
