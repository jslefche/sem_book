[5.3 Exogenous Categorical Variables as Marginal Means: A Worked Example]

No spelling, grammar or punctuation changes here. But there are a 
couple of points about my experience reading it that I think can be
improved upon for other readers.

a) A link to the file bowen.csv that you used would be helpful.
   I wanted to run the file but couldn't locate the link, and
   I didn't have the patience to hunt it down on the internet.

b) Actual terms used in the data set should be linked to the terms
   you use in your description of the model. For example, it
   is not clear what variable name from the bowen data set
   corresponds to "richness" in your description of the model.

[A few other problems that I corrected in the above recommendation:

a) I removed "then" from "then the author" because "then" is understood.
b) "it's" should be "its" As a possessive pronoun, "its" does not take an apostrophe.
c) I added a comma after "the effects of pesticide", because it is known. It's evident to anyone "in the know", but just to emphasize a point, you are saying it anyway.

[7.3 Latent Variables in lavaan]

[Below statement is not clear to me. If the unstandardized coefficient is unchanged, it is not clear how it is unchanged -- especially since the unstandardized coefficient of the previous model (where the error for x was fixed) seems to be very different.]

The unstandardized coefficient, however, is unchanged: � = 0.792. This is in contrast to the earlier latent variable model, where the unstandardized estimate was 0.989.

[The below sentence appears to be contradictory. First, it claims that incorporating measurement error in endogenous latent variables "resolves some of the downward bias" in the "unstandardized coefficient and error variance" but "not the unstandardized coefficient." But it just said that it does resolve some of the downward bias in the undstandardized coefficient.]

[from Audrey Barker-Plotkin]

Note that the unstandardized coefficient is no longer 1: this is because the scale of the composite has been set to that of the second indicator. However, the standardized coefficient is different from what we know the true relationship to be (0.236 vs. 0.177).
For this reason, it is generally recommended that one compute the loadings by hand and fix them in the model. This has an added benefit we will get to in a later section. But first let’s explore a real-world example.)
I’m pretty sure the two approaches do both come to the same standardized coefficient (0.177). Maybe there is a different example you could use where the two differ, to support your final point.

3.2 Test of Directed Separation
"In the case of underidentified models (those where there are more pieces of known information than parameters to be estimated), this means there are missing relationships that could be present but were not included."

Should this possibly say underidentified models have fewer pieces of known information?

chapter 2.2
The text explains this in the following way: "Introducing this path raises a new issue: the relationship between y1 and y2 now arises from two sources. The first is their direct link, the second is from the indirect effect of 
x1x1 through y1." 
This was confusing to me because, in this path diagram, there appears to be only one relationship between y1 and y2 since there is only one arrow coming from y1. Furthermore, this explanation ignores the new path that was just drawn between x1 and y2, which seemed to be the point of this section. Is it possible that y1 in the highlighted section should say x1? This would make more sense to me, but I am still learning the theory and math behind this.
